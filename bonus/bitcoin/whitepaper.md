The Bitcoin whitepaper pdf was encoded in the blockhain in April 2013, in transaction `54e48e5f5c656b26c3bca14a8c95aa583d07ebe84dde3b7dd4a78f4e4186e713` of block `230,009`.  
The transaction contains 947 outputs! Some explanations on how the paper is encoded in the transaction is given in a [Bitcoin stackexchange post](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/35959/how-is-the-whitepaper-decoded-from-the-blockchain-tx-with-1000x-m-of-n-multisi/35970#35970){:target="_blank"} from 2015.  
  
It is possible to extract the data directly from the blockchain data on your own node and re-create the pdf from it. 

### Download the pdf

* With the "admin" user, create a new directory to store the pdf and move to this directory

  ```sh
  $ mkdir whitepaper
  $ cd whitepaper
  ```

* Use bitcoin-cli to download and create the pdf

  ```sh
  $ bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 54e48e5f5c656b26c3bca14a8c95aa583d07ebe84dde3b7dd4a78f4e4186e713 true |
  jq -r '.vout[].scriptPubKey.asm' | cut -c3- |
  xxd -p -r | tail +9c | head -c 184292 > bitcoin.pdf
  $ ls -la
  > bitcoin.pdf
  ```
  
### Send the pdf to your desktop computer (Linux only)
  
The pdf can now be sent from the remote node to the local computer using the [scp](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html){:target="_blank"} utiliy.
The following command only works on Linux-based computers.

* On your local computer, open a terminal window and type the following command (replace <your_node_IP> with the Raspberry Pi IP address (or raspibolt.local if it works) and do not forget the dot at the end of the line

  ```sh
  $ scp admin@<your_node_IP>:~/whitepaper/bitcoin.pdf .
  ```
  
* The file should now be located in the Home folder of your local computer (e.g. /home/<username>).
  
### Send the pdf to your Telegram account

  $ curl -v -F "chat_id=<your_chat_ID>" -F document=@/home/admin/whitepaper/bitcoin.pdf https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_bot_ID>/sendDocument
  ```

  ```sh
  $ nano whitepaper.sh
  ```
  
  ```ini
  #!/usr/bin/bash

  jq -r '.vout[].scriptPubKey.asm' | cut -c3- |
  xxd -p -r | tail +9c | head -c 184292 > bitcoin.pdf

  curl -v -F "chat_id=<your_chat_ID>" -F document=@/home/admin/whitepaper/bitcoin.pdf https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_bot_ID>/sendDocument
  ```

  ```sh
  $ cd ~/
  $ ~/whitepaper/whitepaper.sh
  ```

### Trivia: Read the paper in the BTC-RPC-Explorer 

The BTC-RPC-Explorer has also a functionality to extract the data from the node and display the pdf in the web browser.

* Look-up the transaction ID in the explorer: `54e48e5f5c656b26c3bca14a8c95aa583d07ebe84dde3b7dd4a78f4e4186e713`

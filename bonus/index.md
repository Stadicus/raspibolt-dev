# Bonus Section
{: .no_toc }

In this section, you can find various optional topics that make your RaspiBolt running even smoother. I split this up in various subsections, as the individual tasks can be quite long.

ðŸš¨ This section is not maintained as frequently and not tested as thoroughly as the main part of the guide. To use with caution!

## Labels

Labels are located at the top of each guide to help you

* The first label indicate how difficult is the bonus guide in term of installation procedure and/or use

Difficulty: Easy
{: .label .label-green }

Difficulty: Intermediate
{: .label .label-yellow }

Difficulty: Hard
{: .label .label-red }

* The second label tells you if the guide has been updated and tested on the RaspiBolt v3. If it has been tested, you should be able to follow the guide without encountering any issues. If it has not been tested and updated yet, you might have to modify part of the guide to make it work on a RaspiBolt v3.

Status: Tested v3
{: .label .label-green }

Status: Not tested v3
{: .label .label-yellow }

# Bonus Section
{: .no_toc }

In this section, you can find various optional topics that make your RaspiBolt running even smoother. I split this up in various subsections, as the individual tasks can be quite long.

ðŸš¨ This section is not maintained as frequently and not tested as thoroughly as the main part of the guide. To use with caution!

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

* **[Raspberry Pi](bonus/raspberry_pi/bonus-raspberry-pi.md)**
* **[Bitcoin](bonus/bitcoin/bonus-bitcoin.md)**
* **[Lightning](bonus/lightning/bonus-lightning.md)**

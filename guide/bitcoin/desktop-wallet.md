# Desktop wallet
{: .no_toc }

We install the [Sparrow](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow){:target="_blank"} desktop wallet on a computer and connect it to your Electrum server on your node for private bitcoin on-chain transactions.

## Introduction

We will connect Sparrow to our own Electrum server as it is the most private and secure option. For more information about the privacy and security trade-offs of the various server connection options, read the following [article](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html){:target="_blank"} by Craig Raw, the author of Sparrow.

We will set up Sparrow to connect to Electrs within your local network. There is also an optional section at the end that explains how to connect Sparrow to Electrs using Tor for when you're on the move. 

Sparrow also connects to a couple of external services to get the Bitcoin price and communicate with the Whirlpool server during coinjoin operations. By default, it uses clearnet which leaks your computer IP address to these services and degrade your privacy. However, Sparrow can also connect to them using a Tor proxy. Whether you are using Tor or not to connect to your node, in both cases we will set up the Tor proxy for Sparrow to privately connect to these external services.

## Preparations

### Tor

For Sparrow to connect to the external services via Tor, Tor has to be running on your computer. You can run the Tor Browser and use port 9150 on localhost or else run Tor as a background service and use port 9050.

Here, we'll use the Tor Browser and port 9150 as it is easier to set up on Windows and macOS.

* Install the Tor Browser on your computer by following [this guide](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/installation/){:target="_blank"}.
* Launch the Tor Browser
* Click on "Always connect automatically" and "Connect"
* Keep the Tor Browser running while using Sparrow

*Note:* For Linux Debian-based OS users, you might prefer to just have Tor running in the background and not have to open the Tor Browser each time you're using Sparrow. If so, instead of intalling the browser, simply install Tor with `sudo apt install tor` and check that it is running with `systemctl status tor`.

## Installation

Still on your local computer, download, verify and install Sparrow.

* [Using the instructions on this page](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/download/){:target="_blank"}: 
  * Download the required version for your OS
  * Download the manifest and manifest signature files
  * Verify the release
  * Install Sparrow

## Local connection

We now configure Sparrow to connect to your node within your local network.

### Launch Sparrow

* Launch Sparrow
* Read carefully the introductory messages and click on "Next" several times
* When you reach the "Connecting to a Private Electrum Server" message, click on "Configure Server"

### Connect to Electrs

* Click on the "Private Electrum" tab
* On the "URL" line, paste `raspibolt.local` or your node IP (e.g. `192.168.0.20`) in the first box and `50002` in the second box
* Enable SSL by clicking on the slider
* Enable the Tor proxy by clicking on the "Use proxy" slider
* On the "Proxy URL" line, paste `127.0.0.1` in the first box and either `9150` or `9050` in the second box depending if you run the Tor Browser or Tor as a background service.
* Click on "Test Connection". A green tick should appear on the button and you should see something similar to the following output:

  ```
  > Connected to electrs/0.9.5 on protocol version 1.4
  > [...]
  ```

If there is a connection error message, try the following troubleshooting:
* Make sure that your computer is not connected to any "guest" WiFi network at home. A "guest" WiFi network prevents the computer to connect to any other devices on the local network, such as your node.
* If you have used Sparrow before on this computer, try to connect again after deleting the existing certificates that are stored within the `certs` folder:
  * On Windows: `C:\Users\remi\AppData\Roaming\Sparrow\certs`
  * On macOS: `~/.sparrow/cert`
  * On Linux: `~/.sparrow/cert`

Now, let's go back to the wallet and check that the server and proxy are working properly.

* Close the server configuration window
* Check the two icons in the bottom right corner of the wallet window ![status icons](../../images/sparrow-server-proxy-icons.png)
  * The first icon should be grey, not red; and a mouse hover should display "External Tor proxy enabled"
  * The second icon should be a blue slider button and a mouse over should display "Connected to [...] at height [...]"

You're set! Sparrow is now configured to connect to your Electrum server from within your LAN.

## (Optional) Remote connection over Tor

If you want to use Sparrow outside your LAN, when you're on the go, you can use a connection over Tor.

### Server Tor address

To connect via Tor to Electrs, the server must have a Tor hidden service connection address. Make sure you have set up a Tor hidden service as explained in the ["Electrum server" guide](electrum-server.md#remote-access-over-tor-optional).

If you've already set up the hidden service but lost the connection address, 
you can obtain it again by running the following command with "admin" on your node:

  ```
  $ sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_electrs/hostname`
  > abcd...1234.onion
  ```

### Sparrow configuration

* Open Sparrow
* Navigate to the server configuration page by hitting `Ctrl`+`p` then click on "Server"
* Click on the "Private Electrum" tab. If you've already have an existing clearnet connection, click on "Edit Existing Connection".
* On the "URL" line, paste your Tor hidden service connection address (e.g. "abcd...1234.onion") in the first box and `50002` in the second box
* Enable SSL by clicking on the slider
* Enable the Tor proxy by clicking on the "Use proxy" slider
* On the "Proxy URL" line, paste `127.0.0.1` in the first box and either `9150` or `9050` in the second box depending if you run the Tor Browser or Tor as a background service.
* Click on "Test Connection". A green tick should appear on the button and you should see something similar to the following output:

  ```
  > Connected to [...] on protocol version 1.4
  > [...]
  ```

You're set! Sparrow is now configured to connect to your node over Tor and you can use it wherever you are.
